# Road-Map

This is my list of feature I would like to see being supported by my API:

- Getting addition input working (Battery, ...) 
- Using the haptic feedback
- Playing audio through all channels (somewhat related to haptic feedback)
- Listening to the user with the integrated microphone
- Controlling all that audio related stuff (Volume / Mute / ...)
